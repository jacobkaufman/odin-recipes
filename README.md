# odin-recipes
In this project I am putting my skills to the test to create a basic recipe website. The website will have an index page and will link to a few recipes.
Skills that I am using in this project are:

- Use git commands ex. (git clone, commit...)
- Use html document setup and elements ex. (!DOCTYPE, html, em, strong...)
- Use command line tasks (cd, mkdir...)
- Practice Microsoft Visual Studio Code

Reflection

Wow, already I have forgotten the proper steps when jusing git and also the proper commands. No worries, I simply went back to a previous lesson to re-learn them. This has taught me the importance of practice and how easy some things slip from our memory. I found this project fun to work on because of the simplicty.
