# odin-recipes
In this project I am putting my skills to the test to create a basic recipe website. The website will have an index page and will link to a few recipes.
Skills that I am using in this project are:

- Use git commands ex. (git clone, commit...)
- Use html document setup and elements ex. (!DOCTYPE, html, em, strong...)
- Use command line tasks (cd, mkdir...)
- Practice Microsoft Visual Studio Code
